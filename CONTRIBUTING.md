## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our Code of Conduct. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all contributors.

## Getting Started

### Types of Contributions

We welcome several types of contributions:

- **Bug fixes** - Help us fix issues and improve stability
- **New features** - Add functionality that benefits all users
- **Documentation** - Improve README, code comments, or add examples
- **Testing** - Increase test coverage or improve test quality
- **Performance** - Optimize code for better performance
- **Code quality** - Refactor code for better maintainability

### Before You Start

1. Check existing [issues](https://github.com/theany-org/clockman/issues) to avoid duplicate work
2. For major changes, open an issue first to discuss your proposal
3. Fork the repository and create a feature branch

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Git
- A text editor or IDE

### Setup Instructions

1. **Fork and clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/theany-org/clockman.git
   cd clockman
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install development dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

4. **Verify the setup**

   ```bash
   # Run tests
   pytest

   # Check code style
   black --check clockman/
   isort --check-only clockman/

   # Type checking
   mypy clockman/
   ```

## Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:

- `feature/add-export-functionality`
- `bugfix/fix-timezone-handling`
- `docs/update-installation-guide`

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a new branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**

   - Write clean, readable code
   - Follow existing patterns and conventions
   - Add docstrings for new functions and classes
   - Update type hints as needed

3. **Test your changes**

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

4. **Run code quality checks**

   ```bash
   black clockman/
   isort clockman/
   flake8 clockman/
   mypy clockman/
   ```

## Testing

We maintain high test coverage (target: 90%+). Please include tests for your changes.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=clockman --cov-report=html

# Run specific test categories
pytest -m unit           # Unit tests only
pytest -m integration    # Integration tests only
pytest -m "not slow"     # Skip slow tests
```

### Writing Tests

- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions and classes
- **Integration tests**: Test component interactions
- **End-to-end tests**: Test complete workflows

Example test structure:

```python
def test_start_tracking_session():
    """Test starting a new tracking session."""
    # Arrange
    clockman = TimeTracker()

    # Act
    session = clockman.start("Test task", tags=["test"])

    # Assert
    assert session.description == "Test task"
    assert "test" in session.tags
```

## Code Style

We use several tools to maintain consistent code style:

### Formatting

- **Black** for code formatting (88 character line length)
- **isort** for import sorting

### Linting

- **flake8** for style and error checking
- **mypy** for type checking

### Standards

- Use type hints for all functions and methods
- Write descriptive docstrings (Google style)
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use meaningful variable and function names

Example:

```python
def calculate_session_duration(start_time: datetime, end_time: datetime) -> timedelta:
    """Calculate the duration of a tracking session.

    Args:
        start_time: When the session started
        end_time: When the session ended

    Returns:
        The duration as a timedelta object

    Raises:
        ValueError: If end_time is before start_time
    """
    if end_time < start_time:
        raise ValueError("End time cannot be before start time")

    return end_time - start_time
```

## Submitting Changes

### Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure your code passes all checks**

   ```bash
   pytest
   black --check clockman/
   isort --check-only clockman/
   flake8 clockman/
   mypy clockman/
   ```

2. **Update documentation** if needed

### Common Tasks

**Adding a new CLI command:**

1. Add command function in `cli/commands.py`
2. Register with Typer app in `cli/main.py`
3. Add tests in `tests/cli/`
4. Update help documentation

**Adding a new database model:**

1. Define model in `db/models.py`
2. Create migration if needed
3. Add repository methods in `db/repository.py`
4. Add tests in `tests/db/`
